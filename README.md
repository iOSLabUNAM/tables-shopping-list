# Shopping List
Create a shopping list application that allows users to add items to their list and remove them intuitively using gestures. The implementation will include the following features:
- **Shopping List Interface:** The application will present a user interface where users can view a list of shopping items. This list will be represented using a UITableView.
- **Add Items:** Users will be able to add items to the shopping list using a text field and an "Add" button. The entered items will be displayed in the UITableView in real-time.
- **Delete with Gestures:** The distinctive feature of the application will be the ability to delete items from the list using gestures. Swiping a cell to the left will reveal a delete button, allowing the user to remove the item easily.
- **Deletion Confirmation:** When tapping the delete button, a confirmation alert will be displayed to ensure the user indeed wants to delete the item. This will prevent accidental deletions.

## Optional Challenge 
Change the way of adding items by performing a swipe down on the table.
